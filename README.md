# pyCEO

Create management scripts for your applications so you can do things like

	python manage.py runserver

Features:

* Support positional and named arguments.
* You can define a default action
* Uses the docstring of the actions as help.

Example:

	:::Python
    from pyceo import Manager

    manager = Manager()

    @manager.command
    def runserver(host='0.0.0.0', port=None, **kwargs):
        """[-host HOST] [-port PORT]
        Runs the application on the local development server.
        """
        app.run(host, port, **kwargs)


    @manager.command
    def initdb():
        """Create the database tables (if they don't exist)"""
        from app.models import db
        
        db.create_all()


    @manager.command
    def change_password(login, passw):
        """[-login] LOGIN [-passw] NEW_PASSWORD
        Changes the password of an existing user."""
        from app.app import auth
        
        auth.change_password(login, passw)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        manager.run(default='runserver')


Go to the examples/ folder and run

    python manage.py help

to see the result.


## Why don't just use optparse or argparse?

Because this looks better and is easier to use and understand.
